# ParabotOSRS
A WIP provider for OSRS using Parabot


OSRSAccesors.jar needs to be added as a library into your IDE to be able to compile, it can be found here

https://parabot-osrs.000webhostapp.com/OSRSAccessors.jar


When you run Parabot, please make sure to use the argument "-no_sec", as their API doesn't support some of the System calls OSRS uses.
